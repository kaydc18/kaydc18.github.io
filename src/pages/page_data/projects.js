      overview:
        "As part of a small contract team, I worked with another developer to deliver a fast, static marketing site for a client using modern front-end tools.",
      problem:
        "The client wanted a performance-optimized, maintainable build that supported visual consistency across pages.",
      approach:
        "They chose Gatsby for its static generation and integrated Storybook for component-driven development. I helped plan the component structure, implement pages, and ensure the codebase was easy to maintain for future updates.",
      solution:
        "We built reusable UI components and styled them with consistent spacing and responsive layouts.",
      impact:
        "The final site was lightweight, performant, and easy for the client to maintain. It demonstrated how a component-driven approach can streamline collaboration between developers and stakeholders.",
